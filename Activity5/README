I thought this Activity was a lot of fun. I thought it was cool to download blender objects that had already been made and mess around with them to make a scene. I also 
thought it was really cool to create one of the default objects and mold it into something using the object editor and face editor features. I was able to mold an object that 
looks like a bullet to fit in the scene with the grenade. By placing the objects in a certain poition I was able to make it look like one of the grenades was resting on top of the
other and the bullet were sitting on the plane.
