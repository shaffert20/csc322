Checkpoint 4 Discuss the changes beween checkpoint 2 and checkpoint 2:
The rendered image in checkpoint 3 is zoomed way out and a lot smaller than checkpoint 2 because of how drastically the resolution was reduced.

Checkpoint 6 Compare images from checkpoint 5 to checkpoint 2:
I changed the gamma value to 2 and the image got a lot brighter. The surface of the sphere looks to be very glossy and the entire image is brighter than checkpoint 2.

Activity Questions
1. Light interacts differently with objects in real life by either traveling through an object, reflecting off an object, or absorbing the light entirely.
2. We perceive only the colors of the object that are reflected off of the object. Every other color is absorbed.
3. Using a YUV color space is more efficient and reduces the bandwith more than the RGB capture can.
4. If you add R+G+B of light together it equals a white light which is much different than what mixing red green and blue would be for paint. The rules are much different than mixing colors for paint.
5. The green screen is green because of the cleanliness and luminescense of green. It has to be a color that the object isn't.
6. It makes the image look realistic.
7. The color we see is a result of which wavelengths are reflected back to our eyes.
