Checkpoint 1 pxy = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2] Checkpoint 2 pyx = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2] Checkpoint 3 Tworld cube equals (3 0 3) Checkpoint 4 Tworld2 (3 -.41421 2 Checkpoint 6 The last two images look the exact same even though the camera is in different locations. This is because the focal length was adjusted to make the pictures look the same. The first image is a little different because its from a different location and the focal length isn't adjusted to look the exact same.

I found the beginning parts of this activity to be difficult, as I am not very well versed in matrix multiplication. It did prove to be helpful in that sense though because
I gained a bigger understanding of matrices as a whole even if I might not have correctly figured out the matrices. The actual rendering activities proved to be helpful in
getting me acquainted with blender and adjusting images/objects within.
