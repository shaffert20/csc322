Checkpoint 1: I don't know if I did something wrong but I rendered all 9 images and they all look exactly the same to me. I don't know if theres something wrong with my computer 
or if thats how its supposed to be but each image looks exactly the same even tho they have different settings for each pass
Checkpoint 2: The motion blur image is taken at keyframe 2 because that is when the cube is actually in motion. Since motion blur is enabled we don't get a clear look at the cube
as it is blurred since it is in motion. It is pretty cool render of the cube moving.
Checkpoint 3: In checkpoint 3 it is obvious that the glass sphere is the main focus of the picture because the background around it is fairly blurry and obviously not the main
point of the render. By focusing on the glass sphere we put all the other objects in the scene out of focus.
Checkpoint 4: Adding the cube that surrounds the scene and setting its density to .1 creates a bit of a foggy look to the scene. You can tell that the image is being clouded by 
something and the whole thing comes out much blurrier than any of the other renders. The objects towards the front are easier to see than those towards the back.
