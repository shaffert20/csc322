Checkpoint 1 pxy = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2]
Checkpoint 2 pyx = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2]
Checkpoint 3 Tworld cube equals (3 0 3)
Checkpoint 4 Tworld2 (3 -.41421 2
Checkpoint 6 The last two images look the exact same even though the camera is in different locations. This is because the focal length was adjusted to make the pictures look the same. The first image is a little different because its from a different location and the focal length isn't adjusted to look the exact same.
