Checkpoint 1 pxy = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2]
Checkpoint 2 pyx = [cos pi/4 0 0, 0 cos pi/4 -sin pi/4, 0 0 (cos pi/4)^2]
Checkpoint 3 I really don't know how to do this. I set the plane to (1 1 2) but I don't know how to apply the matrix to it to figure out what the location of the cube should be.
