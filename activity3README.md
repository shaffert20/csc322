Checkpoint 1.3: Smooth shading makes it so the UV sphere is shaped more as a sphere. It makes the edges smooth so that the shape isn't covered in polygons like the FlatShading image is
Checkpoint 1.6: Subdivision makes it so if you use flat shading the object will look far more smoother than without subdivision. When using subdivision and smooth shading, the image comes out to be very smooth. 
The image with subdivision and smooth shading is smooth all the way around and looks a lot smoother than the smooth shading image that was rendered without subdivision.
